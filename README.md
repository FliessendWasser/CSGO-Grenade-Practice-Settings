## CSGO-Grenade-Practice-Settings

This is a readme for this repository.
While it seems that I need a lot of coding knowledge to let this file look good, it ends here.




### Description:

This config represents settings that can be used on dedicated servers with rcon access or on local servers, running Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
It allows the player to activate certain settings for more useful insights to fully understand on how grenades (smokes, flashes, HE's, decoys) work, what kind of walls are penetratable and how the shots of different weapons hit (aka impacts).
